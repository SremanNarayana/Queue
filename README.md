# Queue
It is named queue as it behaves like a real-world queue, for example â€“ queue(line) of cars in a single lane, queue of people waiting at food counter etc.
Queue is an abstract data type with a bounded (predefined) capacity.
It is a simple data structure that allows adding and removing elements in a particular order.
The order is FIFO(First IN First OUT) or LILO(Last In Last Out).
